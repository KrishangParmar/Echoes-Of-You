# Horror Tone Guidelines for "Echoes of You"

## Narrative Voice
When writing or reviewing content for "Echoes of You", maintain these tonal principles:

### Atmosphere
- **Psychological over gore**: Focus on unease, dread, and emotional weight rather than explicit violence
- **Ambiguity**: Leave room for interpretation; the unknown is scarier than the explicit
- **Personal stakes**: Ground horror in relatable emotions (regret, loss, guilt, memory)
- **Subtle dread**: Build tension through implication and atmosphere

### Language Style
- Use evocative, sensory language (shadows, whispers, echoes, fading, cold)
- Prefer shorter sentences for impact and tension
- Avoid humor unless it's dark/ironic and serves the atmosphere
- Use second-person ("you") to create intimacy and discomfort

### Question Design
Questions should:
- Present moral dilemmas without clear "right" answers
- Reference past events or memories
- Create emotional weight through implications
- Use atmospheric descriptions in setup

### Ending Narratives
- **Dark ending**: Embrace tragedy, loss, or horror without redemption
- **Neutral ending**: Bittersweet, ambiguous, lingering questions
- **Light ending**: Hopeful but earned, not saccharine; acknowledge the darkness

## Examples

### Good ✓
"The photograph fades in your hands. Do you remember what you've forgotten?"

### Avoid ✗
"Hey there! Time to make a fun choice! 😊"

## Visual Consistency
- Dark color palettes (blacks, deep purples, blood reds)
- Distressed or gothic typography
- Minimal UI that doesn't distract from atmosphere
- Smooth, deliberate transitions (not jarring or comedic)
